This project is a computational identification of prospective compounds exhibiting heightened potency and selectivity against Trypanosoma Cruzi. Our focus areas include AI implementation and Data analytics solutions. 
Starting from a known active and effective compound (CID_18) whose chemical structure contains a functional group chromane, we generated a library of 17,946 bioactive compounds with a chromane scaffold. We prioritized candidates training  3 machine learning classifier models using 15 physicochemical properties of compounds with reported activity (or inactivity) on T. cruzi and human targets to predict activity against T. cruzi and discard undesired interactions in humans. The best model for each organism was applied to the complete chromane library to predict their respective activity. As a result, we obtained 131 lead compounds with a chromane scaffold, shape and distribution of chemical features similar to CID_18, and with predicted activity and selectivity on T. cruzi. Next, we will curate and acquire candidates from this list which will be assayed in vitro, against T. cruzi amastigotes.Â
